# Team config

Shared omp setup for the team: agents, rules, skills, the merge-gate extension, global
instructions, and the onara model router. `scripts/deploy-local.sh` builds omp and syncs this
directory into the omp agent dir (`~/.omp/agent`) from the same commit as the binary.

## New machine

Prerequisites: [bun](https://bun.sh), a Rust toolchain ([rustup](https://rustup.rs)), `git`,
and `node` (the merge-gate extension runs its validator with it). On NixOS, `nix` replaces bun/rust:
the deploy script re-enters the flake dev shell.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:KimToehler/oh-my-pi.git ~/git/oh-my-pi
cd ~/git/oh-my-pi
scripts/deploy-local.sh                       # builds omp, installs ~/.local/bin/omp, syncs this config
{ [ ! -e ~/.omp/agent/.env ] && [ ! -L ~/.omp/agent/.env ] || { [ -f ~/.omp/agent/.env ] && [ ! -L ~/.omp/agent/.env ]; }; } &&  # absent, or a regular non-symlink file: else stop before touch/chmod
  ( umask 077; touch ~/.omp/agent/.env ) && chmod 600 ~/.omp/agent/.env &&   # mode 600 before any key is written
  [ -f ~/.omp/agent/.env ] && [ ! -L ~/.omp/agent/.env ] &&                # a directory or symlink stops here, before read
  printf 'Router key: ' && read -rs ONARA_ROUTER_KEY && echo &&            # no echo, not in shell history (zsh and bash)
  printf 'ONARA_ROUTER_KEY=%s\n' "$ONARA_ROUTER_KEY" >> ~/.omp/agent/.env; unset ONARA_ROUTER_KEY
omp                                           # ~/.local/bin must be on PATH
```

Update later with `git pull && scripts/deploy-local.sh`. Restart running omp sessions
(including IntelliJ ACP) afterwards.

## What lands where

| Repo path | Target | On every deploy |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/**` (`AGENTS.md`, `agents/`, `rules/`, `skills/`, `extensions/`) | `~/.omp/agent/**` | Overwritten; files removed here are removed there |
| `seed/config.yml`, `seed/models.yml` | `~/.omp/agent/` | Copied only if missing; your edits are kept |

The installer records what it shipped in `~/.omp/agent/.team-config-manifest.json`. Files it did
not ship are never touched. If a shipped file was edited locally, or a same-named file existed
before the first deploy (even an identical one: the installer only owns files it wrote itself), its previous content is moved to a fresh `~/.omp/agent/backups/team-config-<time>-<random>/`
before it is replaced; the deploy output names the directory.

`OMP_SKIP_TEAM_CONFIG=1 scripts/deploy-local.sh` installs only the binary.

## Personal settings

- Personal instructions (role, stack, language): `AGENTS.local.md` in the agent dir (default
  `~/.omp/agent`). It loads only while `contextFiles.extra` lists it. The seeded `config.yml`
  does; a pre-existing `config.yml` needs `contextFiles: { extra: [AGENTS.local.md] }` added by
  hand. A project-level `contextFiles.extra` replaces the user list, so the agent-dir file is
  then not read.
- Personal rules or skills: any other file name under `~/.omp/agent/rules/` or `skills/`.
- Model roles, approval mode, bash patterns: edit `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` directly.
  After a team change to `seed/config.yml`, compare with
  `diff ~/.omp/agent/config.yml team-config/seed/config.yml` and merge what you want.
- Do not edit shipped files in `~/.omp/agent`; the next deploy replaces them (with a backup).
  Change them here and open a PR instead.

## Changing the team config

Edit files under `team-config/`, then run `bun run test:team-config`. It covers the merge-gate
extension, the gate validator, and the installer. Rules carry no repo-private paths or
evidence: this repository is public.
