# Design

## Context

New standalone Bun/TypeScript project; no existing consumers.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Every amount is a whole number of cents; every division is rounded down with `Math.floor`, so no fractional cent ever enters a result.
- Fee calculation and rendering stay independent modules: the renderer formats precomputed data and never computes a fee.

**Non-Goals:**
- Selecting or ordering invoices, date handling, currency conversion, persistence, input file validation beyond what rendering needs.

## Decisions

- `lateFee(amountCents, daysOverdue)` takes whole numbers: periods are `floor(days / 30)`, the percent is capped at 25, and the fee is integer division rounded down.
- `renderReport` prints the lines in the order given; ordering is the caller's concern.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Inputs are trusted whole numbers from a machine-generated export; malformed input is not diagnosed.
