# Spec Delta

## Purpose
Late fee accrual for overdue invoices and the text rendering of the fee report for finance follow-up.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Late fee from amount and days overdue
The late fee of an invoice SHALL be 2% of its amount in cents for each complete 30-day period it is overdue, capped at 25% of the amount, in whole cents rounded down. The amount and the days overdue are non-negative whole numbers.

#### Scenario: One complete period
- **WHEN** the fee is computed for an amount of 10000 cents that is 30 days overdue
- **THEN** the late fee is 200 cents

#### Scenario: Fee cap
- **WHEN** the fee is computed for an amount of 10000 cents that is 400 days overdue
- **THEN** the late fee is 2500 cents

#### Scenario: Negative control
- **WHEN** the fee is computed for an amount of 10000 cents that is 29 days overdue
- **THEN** any late fee above 0 cents MUST fail this requirement

### Requirement: Fee report rendering
A report with lines SHALL render one text line per report line in the given order (id, TAB, due date, TAB, fee), then a last line of `TOTAL`, two TABs and the total of all fees. Every amount SHALL be shown in whole units with exactly two decimals and a comma after every group of three integer digits counted from the right (5 cents is `0.05`). A report with no lines SHALL render as exactly `No late fees`. The `render` command prints the rendered text and one newline.

#### Scenario: Lines and total
- **WHEN** a report with the lines `a`/`2026-01-10`/200 cents and `b`/`2026-01-12`/1250 cents is rendered
- **THEN** the output is `a`, TAB, `2026-01-10`, TAB, `2.00`, a newline, `b`, TAB, `2026-01-12`, TAB, `12.50`, a newline and `TOTAL`, two TABs and `14.50`

#### Scenario: Large fee grouped
- **WHEN** a report with one line `big`/`2026-01-10`/123456789 cents is rendered
- **THEN** both the fee of that line and the total are shown as `1,234,567.89`

#### Scenario: Negative control
- **WHEN** a report with no lines is rendered
- **THEN** any rendered text other than exactly `No late fees`, including a `TOTAL` line, MUST fail this requirement
